# openvpn.yml

## The script

-   Creates a new user named "vpn" with password-less sudo capabilities
-   Makes SSH available on port 4444

## Client configuration

OpenVPN is configured automatically and the client certificate is available at `/home/vpn/client.ovpn` at your newly installed OpenVPN server. Then follow these steps:

1.  Transfer this ovpn file to your client (Windows: `C:\Users<USERNAME>\OpenVPN\config`) using scp like so: `scp -P 4444 vpn@IPADDRESS:/home/vpn/client.ovpn client.ovpn`
2.  Install the OpenVPN client.
3.  Run the OpenVPN client (see the system tray in Windows).
4.  Click yes if asked to add yourself to the "OpenVPN Administrators" group (administrator password required)
